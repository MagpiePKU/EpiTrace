Overview of tutorial
--------------------

EpiTrace is a new tool for the community. To facilitate your use, we put together 5 showcase examples in this tutorial. These examples start from simple function usage with :doc:`a small, human bulk ATAC-seq dataset<Bulk_ATAC>`, then begin to embark on real single-cell ATAC dataset -- which is still :doc:`human-origin<scATAC_cIPSC>`. 

Then, the tutorial extend to single cell ATAC datasets of non-human mammalian species (:doc:`mouse<scATAC_cIPSC>`), before going further to invertebrate species (:doc:`drosophila<scATAC_drosophila>`). The tutorial ends with a hypothesis-driven study scenario, in which the single cell age information would be integrated :doc:`with genetic information to answer a question<mtscATAC_CD34>`.  

We hope these tutorials would be of use of the research community. If you have specific question and ideas, please raise an 
`issue <https://github.com/MagpiePKU/EpiTrace/issues/new>`_.
