Description: Inference of cell age and phylogeny from single cell ATAC data.  
    Clock-like DNA methylation are enriched in active regulatory genomic loci which 
    are accessible via single cell ATAC sequencing. Chromatin accessiblity on these loci 
    are impacted by age-dependent methylation change and subjected to stable, 
    trans-generational inheritance. The package leverages such information to:
    1. calculate the age of a cell or a cluster of cell; 
    2. calculate the phylogeny of cell clusters; 
    3. define age-dependent variability of chromatin accessibility.
